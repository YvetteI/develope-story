<h1>My name is Yvette </h1>
<p>
    This my develop story
   
    I first got introduced to computers when I came to America.<br>
    The first time I was introduced to coding was In my 5th grade technology class, where we would go to this website called coding.<br>
    com and complete coding games. <br>
    I havenâ€™t really been into coding since 5th grade but I'm really grateful that I have this class. So I can get back into it.<br>
    I joined the refcode class because I wanted to expand  my skills in coding.
